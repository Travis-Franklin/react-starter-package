1. npx create-react-app name-of-app

2. cd into-name-of-app-just-created

3. npm start

start in app.js, don't really touch index.js

jsx looks like html,  but is written in javascript. 

1 component per file

All files should go into source directory, because that is where REact is looking for component

when setting up a component file, you need to :
import React from 'react';

fucntion createFunction (){

};

export default createFunction;

Make sure function name and file name are capitalized.
