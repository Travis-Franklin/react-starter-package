1. npx create-react-app name-of-app

2. cd into-name-of-app-just-created

3. npm start

start in app.js, don't really touch index.js

jsx looks like html,  but is written in javascript. 

1 component per file

All files should go into source directory, because that is where REact is looking for component

when setting up a component file, you need to :
import React from 'react';

fucntion createFunction (){
    return (
        <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        </div>
    );
}


export default createFunction;

Make sure function name and file name are capitalized. 


FOR IMPORTING data into a component file, or helper function, you can save a variable in your App.js:

let websiteCopy="lorem impsum"

function APP (){
    return (
        <Counter/>
        <Maincontent content={websiteCopy}/>
    );
}

export default App;
