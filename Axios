Axios is library that sends requests. 
--hey server, I'm talking to you from react

Express is when you create a server that is listening for requests. 

AJAX= asynchronous javascript and XML, more of a technique not a technology, can substitue ajax, axios, get
Axios is the most popular


import axios from 'axios';
const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://endpoint.com'

axios.get(API_ENDPOINT)
    .then (response => {
        console.log(response);
    })


NEXT:

note: data is the term that axios has built in that accesses the information we will need. 
Add .key in order to access the object, below the key is .name


function App() {
    axios.get(API_ENDPOINT)
    .then (response => {
        console.log(response.data.name);
    })
}

Turn it into a class

class App extends React.Component {
    constructor (props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            name: 'not their real name'
        }
    }

    render () {
        return (
            <header>{this.state.name}</header>

        )
    }


}
